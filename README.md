## üìÅ Project Overview

Cervical cancer remains a major global health concern, responsible for approximately 300,000 deaths annually worldwide. Despite being preventable through early detection and regular screening, many cases go undiagnosed due to lack of access to healthcare or awareness.

In this hands-on project, a machine learning model is developed to predict the risk of cervical cancer using patient data. The dataset includes medical and demographic information from 858 individuals, covering features such as pregnancy count, smoking habits, sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), contraceptive use, and medical history.

The model leverages the XGBoost classification algorithm, known for its performance on structured datasets and ability to handle missing values. Through data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and model training, this project demonstrates how machine learning can be applied to support early detection and decision-making in the healthcare domain.

Risk factors such as persistent Human Papillomavirus (HPV) infection, high sexual activity, oral contraceptive use, smoking, and immunodeficiency (e.g., HIV/AIDS) are considered as part of the analysis. The final model is evaluated using standard classification metrics to assess its predictive power.


The workflow covers every critical step in a machine learning pipeline:

- Understanding the problem and the dataset
- Handling missing values and preparing features
- Performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) and visualizations
- Applying feature scaling
- Training and evaluating the model using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score

XGBoost was selected for its efficiency, interpretability, and strong performance on structured data. This project was completed through a guided Coursera course and serves as a practical demonstration of end-to-end classification model building.
